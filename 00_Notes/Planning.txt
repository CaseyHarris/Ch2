Used Bayesian network to evaluate hydroclimate variables on wq variables
included probability of exceeding thresholds
little change in wq due to climate change

streamflow is the biggest predictor of water quality



In the lower Mississippi River, nitrate concentrations 



During the 20th century, the total area of the U.S. covered by farmland increased by 11.5%, but the way that farmland was managed changed markedly -- the number of farms decreased while average farm size increased, farm machinery and nutrient management management practices -- tillage, drainage, fertilizers. Nitrate-nitrite concentrations correlated with agricultural land use, but the slope of the relationship in the early 1900s vs l990s was different (Broussard and Turner 2009)

Nutrients may be temporally redistributed instead of changed overall in the future (Tu 2009)



Decreasing nutrient concentrations at urbanized sites and little change at agricultural sites

Clean Water Act resulted in decreasing point discharges of pollutants, best management practices have decreased nonpoint pollution from agriculture in some cases

Effects of land-use changes may not be noticeable for years or even decades, or at all where extreme flows strongly affect annual concentration trends

A study of nitrogen in Iowa rivers showed that the effects of land-use changed

In a study of nitrogen in Iowa rivers, the effects of land-use changes weren't noticeable for years or even decades, especially in basins with longer subsurface residence times (Green et al. 2014)
